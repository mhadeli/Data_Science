## Diabetes Health Indicators - Predictive Modeling

The primary task for the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset is to develop a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes based on various health indicators. The overall goal is to improve early detection and intervention, leading to better health outcomes for at-risk individuals. To achieve this, the following tasks are assigned:

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct a detailed EDA of the dataset to identify relationships between different variables and their impact on diabetes. Explore correlations, visualize distributions, and perform statistical tests to uncover patterns and insights.

**2. Feature Selection and Engineering**: Determine which variables are most important for predicting diabetes and how they can be used to create meaningful features.

**3. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)**: Build and train a MLP model to predict diabetes based on the selected features. Eexperiment with different architectures, activation functions, and regularization techniques to optimize the model's performance.

**4. XGBoost**: Build and train an XGBoost model to predict diabetes based on the selected features. Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, number of estimators, and maximum depth, to optimize the model's performance.

**5. Model Comparison and Evaluation**: Compare the performance of the MLP and XGBoost models using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Perform statistical tests to determine if one model is significantly better than the other.

**6. Future Directions**: Discuss the limitations of the current study and suggest potential future directions for improving diabetes prediction performance.
